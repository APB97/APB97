### About me

My name is Adrian BieliÅ„ski, I am a sofware developer who lives in Poland, I started with C++ programming language and soon after I picked another programming language: C#. It was many years ago (around year 2011), now I am able to create both desktop and web applications with C# and .NET. I am passionate about programming, solving problems and learning.

I feel that the programming language I know the best is C# and I'm exploring different fields which interest me.
