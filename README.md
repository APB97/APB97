## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

My name is Adrian BieliÅ„ski, I come from Poland, and my journey with programming started in 2010 with C++.

In the beginning I didn't do much to expand my knowledge beyond the standards that were taught but a lot of things changed since then - I feel that the programming language I know the best is C# and I'm exploring different fields which interest me.

After some time spent with C++, I picked up another programming language - C# that is.

At that time I had to learn everything on my own - and this wasn't easy - but I was determined because I've hit a roadblock when trying to make Graphical User Inteface with C++.

Having grasped the basic, I was suprised how easy it was to create a GUI - and since then I shifted most of my focus towards learning more about the language and possibilities it provided me with.

### Technologies I know

- C#/.NET
  - Windows Forms
  - Uniwersal Windows Platform
  - Unity
  - ASP.NET MVC
- Python
- C++
  - Unreal Engine 4
- Docker

### Apart from these I've used
- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
